There are a few things to do to make this work.
  1) Install Lunatic [http://niemeyer.net/lunatic-python]
  2) Download Highlight [http://www.andre-simon.de/index.html]
  3) Update consts.py to point THEMES_DIR at the themes directory from
     the highlight package
  4) Update the theme definitions in consts.py (more on this in a bit)
  5) Install Latex dependencies:
     - listings
     - color
     - upquote (can safely be edited out)
     - fullpage (only used for the demo)

Once that's in place, generate a Latex .sty file with:
  $ ./highlight2tex.py > highlights.sty

If you're not interested in going through the hassle of installing all
the dependencies, the only file of interest is highlights.sty - enjoy.

I  use a  common style  definition  for all  my listings  style, so  I
wrapped those  definitions up  in their own  style and  reference them
from all the  other styles. They can be  modified in consts.py through
common_style or listings_style (which references the common style).

There's  also  a  demo-generating  script  for  the  sake  of  showing
off. This will  give a small listing of Python  code repeated once for
each of the 80 themes.
  $ ./texdemo.py > demo.tex
